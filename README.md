# simplessh-go
Easy-to-use non-interactive SSH Client library for Go, suitable for automated tasks where an SSH Client is required.

This library is a work-in-progress, so functionality and usage is subject to change. It is currently in a _somewhat usable_ state, but lacks any documentation. An example can be found under the "examples" directory.

Any enhancements, issues, or suggestions are appreciated.
